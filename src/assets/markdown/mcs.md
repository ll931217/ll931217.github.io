# Material Control System (MCS)

During the time I worked at [Gyro Systems Incorporated (捷螺系統股份有限公司)](https://www.gyro.com.tw), the biggest projects I worked on was the MCS. I was on 2 different versions of the system, one of them was created with my manager for our company and the other one was created with ITRI for SPIL.

My role in both projects is creating an interface for client's and colleagues to run and test equipments produced by us in our client's factories.

## Gyro's MCS

This MCS was created with my manager, I focused on creating the backend server including the database and also the frontend web UI. The goal of the project was to get all the controllers for our hardware, erack, stocker, and AGV to work together.

### Technologies Used:

* Jinja2
* Flask
* Python
* jQuery
* Bootstrap
* MariaDB

## ITRI's MCS

The MCS created with ITRI, I was the lead with another new colleague. One of my tasks was distribute work with him, when he couldn't finish something on time, I would pick up what he couldn't finish. When there is some free time, I would mentor him on best programming practices and techniques.

### Technologies Used:

* Vuejs
* BoostrapVue
* Flask
* Python
* MSSQL

## What I learned from working on these projects

* Proper planning is very important when you want to finish a project on time. Especially when you want everyone on the same track to write better code.
* Leading a team, used Trello to organise and distribute work between members, including issue and features tracking.
* Teaching team member coding techniques to improve their code, and overall application performance.
