# Chronibuild

[ChroniBuild](https://github.com/ll931217/ChroniBuild) is a website I am currently working on which is a character planner for a game called [Chronicon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/375480/Chronicon/). This project has been taking me a while to create because of the sheer amount of images in the game that needs to be extracted. However thanks to [ChoniconDB](https://chronicondb.com/) I got all the assets and data that I need.

This website will include all the ChroniconDB features and also a character planner, basically an all-in-one website.
