### Achievements

This was my first time creating a successful recursive function, however this recursive function is actually a recursive component. This component is a [**Tree View**](https://github.com/ll931217/vue-treeview) for our eracks, this allowed me to create a Vue.js plugin for anyone who wants to use it called [ll931217/vue-treeview](https://github.com/ll931217/vue-treeview).

## Erack Controller

During the first Erack project for SK Hynix, the Erack controller was created by my manager, after that project he passed the code to me to maintain. The code was written in Python which I wasn't familiar with at first but soon got accustomed to it.
